THIS IS A VERY HARD PROJECT!!!

lab1b-client.c : The client end of this project.
 Can have different modes, but has to be used after the server is constructed. 

--port will specify the port number(This is a must). --compress can compress the information applied zlib.
--log command can log out the sending and receiving bytes.

lab1-server.c : The server end of the project. Should be used applied --port mode to construct network. 
--compress is used for compress and decompress information.

REMEMBER: --compress should be used simultaneously!

MAKEFILE:
	make(default make): create the executable lab1b-server and lab1b-client
	make clean : clean tarball and executable
	make dist: make the tarball for submission

REANME:
	Introduce every information about the lab.
