THIS IS A VERY HARD PROJECT!!!

lab1b-client.c : The client end of this project. Can have different modes, but has to be used after the server is constructed. --port will specify the port number(This is a must). --compress can compress the information applied zlib. --log command can log out the sending and receiving bytes.

lab1-server.c : The server end of the project. Should be used applied --port mode to construct network. --compress is used for compress and decompress information.

REMEMBER: --compress should be used simultaneously!

MAKEFILE:
	make(default make): create the executable lab1b-server and lab1b-client
	make clean : clean tarball and executable
	make dist: make the tarball for submission

REANME:
	Introduce every information about the lab.

PERSONAL COMMENT ABOUT THIS LAB:
	This is the hardest thing I have ever done in programming. Although the part1 give us a good insight in process, but network as well as compression of information is really hard to handle. Constructing the network takes me two days to implement. I split the default version and compress version since this can be more stable. The zlib is also hard to work with, I look at the ZLIB usage example. I even look at the source code of deflate and inflate function on the github. while and do-while loop is different here, cost some time to debug.

	I look at this github page to know to initialize zlib: https://gist.github.com/arq5x/5315739
	surce code of zlib I look at : https://github.com/madler/zlib/blob/master/deflate.c
