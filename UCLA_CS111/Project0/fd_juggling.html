<h1>Project 1B<br>
Compressed Network Communication</h1>
</center>

<h2> INTRODUCTION: </h2>
<P>
When an application (e.g., shell) is to be used remotely, it is usually not sufficient to
simply replace local device I/O (e.g., between the user's terminal and the shell) with network
I/O.  Remote sessions and network protocols add options and behaviors that did not exist when
the application was being used locally.
To handle this additional processing without making any changes to the application, it is
common to create client-side and server-side agents that handle the network communication
and shield the application from the complexities of the remote access protocols.
Such intermediary agents can implement valuable features (e.g., encrypting traffic for
enhanced security or compressing traffic to improve the performance and reduce the cost
of WAN-scale communication), completely transparently to the user and application.
</P>
<P>
In this project, you will build a multi-process telnet-like client and
server. This project is a continuation of Project 1A. It can be broken
up into two major steps:
<ul>
	<li> Passing input and output over a TCP socket </li>
	<li> Compressing communication between the client and server</li>
</ul>
</P>

<h2> RELATION TO READING AND LECTURES: </h2>
<p>
This lab will build on the process and exception discussions,
but it is really about researching and exploiting APIs.
</p>

<h2> PROJECT OBJECTIVES: </h2>
<ul>
	<li> Demonstrate the ability to research new APIs and debug code that exploits them </li>
	<li> Demonstrate ability to do basic network communication </li>
	<li> Demonstrate ability to do exploit a new library</li>
	<li> Develop multi-process debugging skills </li>
</ul>

<h2> DELIVERABLES: </h2>

A single tarball (<tt>.tar.gz</tt>) containing:
<ul>
	<li> C source modules that compile cleanly (with no errors or warnings).
		You will have (at least) two source files:
		<tt>lab1b-client.c</tt> and <tt>lab1b-server.c</tt>,
		which should compile to the executables
		<tt>lab1b-client</tt> and <tt>lab1b-server</tt>,
		respectively. </li>
	<li> a <tt>Makefile</tt> to build the program
	     (compiling it with the <strong><tt>-Wall</tt></strong> and
	     <strong><tt>-Wextra</tt></strong> options)
	     and the tarball.
	     It should have distinct targets for the client and
	     server, but it should also have a default target
	     that builds both.
	     It should also have the (now) traditional <tt>clean</tt> and <tt>dist</tt>
	     targets.
	     </li>
	<li> a <tt>README</tt> file describing the contents of the tarball and
	     anything interesting you would like to bring to our attention
	 (e.g., research, limitations, features, testing methodology).</LI>
</ul>

<h2> PROJECT DESCRIPTION: </h2>

	     </li>
</ul>

<h3>Passing input and output over a TCP socket</h3>

<p>
Using Project 1A's <tt>--shell</tt> option as a starting point,
create a client program (<tt>lab1b-client</tt>) and a server program (<tt>lab1b-server</tt>),
both of which support a mandatory
<strong><tt>--port=</tt></strong><em>port#</em> switch. (Note: you can remove the --shell option)
</p>
<div align="center">
<img alt="" src="P1B_design.png">
</div>
<p>
Your overall program design will look like the diagram above.
You will have a client process, a server process, and a shell process.
The first two are connected via TCP connection, and the last two are connected via pipes.
</p>

<h3>The client program</h3>
<ul>
	<li> The client program will open a connection to a server
		(port specified with the mandatory <strong><tt>--port=</tt></strong>
		command line parameter) rather than sending it directly
		to a shell.
		The client should then send input from the
		keyboard to the socket (while echoing to the display), and input from
		the socket to the display.</li>
	<li> Maintain the same non-canonical (character at a time, no echo)
		terminal behavior you used in Project 1A.</li>
	<li> Include, in the client, a <strong><tt>--log=</tt></strong><em>filename</em> option,
		which maintains a record of data sent over the socket (see below).  </li>
	<li> If a <em>^D</em> is entered on the terminal, simply pass it through to
		the server like any other character.</li>
	<li> if a <em>^C</em> is entered on the terminal, simply pass it through to the
		server like any other character.</li>
	<li> In the second part of this project we will add a
		<strong><tt>--compress</tt></strong> switch to the client.</li>
	<li> If the client encounters an unrecognized argument it should print
		an informative usage message (on stderr) and exit with a return code of 1.
		If any system call fails, it should print an informative
		error message (on stderr) and exit with a return code of 1.</li>
	<li> Before exiting, restore normal terminal modes.</li>
</ul>
<P>
For all of this testing, the client and server will be running on the same host
(<tt>localhost</tt>), but if you would like to add a <strong><tt>--host=</tt></strong><em>name</em>
parameter you should be able to access a shell session from other computers.
</p>

<h3>The server program</h3>
<ul>
	<li> The server program will connect with the client, receive the client's
		commands and send them to the shell, and will "serve" the client the
		outputs of those commands. </li>
	<li>The server program will listen on a network socket (port specified with
		the mandatory <strong><tt>--port=</tt></strong> command line parameter).  </li>

	<li> Accept a connection when it is made. </li>
	<li> Once a connection is made, fork a child process,
		which will exec a shell to process commands received;
		the server process should communicate with the shell via pipes
		(as you did in Project 1A).  </li>
	<li> Redirect the shell process's stdin/stdout/stderr to the appropriate pipe ends
		(similar to what you did in Project 1A).</li>
	<li> Input received through the network socket should be forwarded
		through the pipe to the shell.
		Because the server forks the shell (and knows its process ID),
		the processing of <em>^C</em> (turning it into a <tt>SIGINT</tt>
		to the shell) must be done in the server.
		Similarly, when the server encounters a <em>^D</em> it should
		close the write side of the pipe to the shell
		(as was done in project 1A).</li>
	<li> Input received from the shell pipes (which receive both stdout
		and stderr from the shell) should be forwarded out to the
		network socket.</li>
	<li> If the server gets an EOF or <tt>SIGPIPE</tt> from the shell pipes
		(e.g., the shell exits), harvest the shell's completion status,
		log it to stderr (as you did in project 1A), and exit with a return code of 0.</li>
	<li> If the server gets an EOF or read error from the network connection,
		(e.g., the client exits), close the write pipe to the shell,
		await an EOF from the pipe from the shell, and harvest and report
		its termination status (as above).</li>
	<li> If the server encounters an unrecognized argument it should print
		an informative usage message (on stderr) and exit with return code of 1.
		If any system call fails, it should print an informative
		error message (on stderr) and exit with an return code of 1.</li>
	<li> In the second part of this project we will add a
		<strong><tt>--compress</tt></strong> switch to the server.</li>
</ul>
<p>
To send commands to the shell, you will need to start both the client and
the server. On the client side, the behavior should be very similar to
that of Project 1A, in that you will see your commands echoed back to
the terminal as well as the output from the shell. Do not display
anything (other than error messages) on the server side.
</p>

<p>
If you are not familiar with socket programming, you may find this
<a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.cs.rpi.edu/~moorthy/Courses/os98/Pgms/socket.html&sa=D&ust=1475268381481000&usg=AFQjCNGfVN0HaE_dqGa5twvmuq46llwElA"> tutorial</a>
to be useful.  (Note that we are not expecting you to become expert in how
compression in general or this particular form of encryption works.  Your task
is to understand it well enough to use it.)
</p>

<p>
Choose a random port number (greater than 1024) for your testing.
Port numbers below 1024 are reserved.
Be advised that listens may remain active for several seconds after the server exits.
This means that you may get occasional socket-in-use errors if you restart the server before
the old listen is taken down.
</p>

<P>
Because the server is started independently from the client, it will have its own
stderr and stdout which go the terminal session from which it was started.  If you
want to implement debug output from the server, you can send it to the server's
stdout (file descriptor 1).
</p>

<h3>Shut-down Order</h3>
<p>
If the client initiates the closing of the socket, it may not receive the last output from the shell.
To ensure that no output is lost, shut-downs should be initiated from the server side:
<ol type="1">
   <li>	an <em>exit(1)</em> command is sent to the shell, or the server closes the write pipe to the shell.</li>
   <li> the shell exits, causing the server to receive an EOF on the read pipe from the shell.</li>
   <li> the server collects and reports the shell's termination status.</li>
   <li> the server closes the network socket to the client, and exits.</li>
   <li> the client continues to process output from the server until itreceives an error on the network socket from the server.</li>
   <li> the client restores terminal modes and exits.</li>
</ol>
</p>

<P>
After reporting the shell's termination status and closing the network socket, the server should exit.
Otherwise it would tie up the socket and prevent testing new server versions.  After your test is complete,
the client, server, and shell should all be gone.  There should be no remaining orphan processes.
</p>

<h3>The <tt>--log</tt> option</h3>
<p>
To ensure that compression is being correctly done, we will ask you to add a
<strong><tt>--log=</tt></strong><em>filename</em> option to your client.  If this
option is specified, <u>all</u> data written to or read from the server should be logged
to the specified file.
Prefix each log entry with
<strong><tt>SENT</tt></strong> <em>#</em> <strong><tt>bytes:</tt></strong>
or
<strong><tt>RECEIVED</tt></strong> <em>#</em> <strong><tt>bytes:</tt></strong>
as appropriate. (Note the colon and space between the word <tt><strong>bytes</strong></tt>
and the start of the data).
Each of these lines should be followed by a newline character (even if the last character
of the reported string was a newline).
</p>
<p>

</p>
Sample log format output:
<ul>
<strong><tt>SENT 35 bytes: sendingsendingsendingsendingsending</tt></strong><br>
<strong><tt>RECEIVED 18 bytes: receivingreceiving</tt></strong><br>
</ul>

<h3>Compressed communication</h3>
<P>
The purpose of compression is to reduce the amount of space data takes up.  In
communications scenarios, a compressed version of data will use less bandwidth to transmit
the same data than its uncompressed form would use.  On the other hand,
compression will require processing at the sending and receiving end before
the data can be effectively used at the receiving process.  Sometimes the benefits
in reduced bandwidth are worth the costs of extra processing and sometimes they
are not, so compression is not used by default in network communications.
While compression makes data difficult to read, unlike encryption it does
not provide any privacy for the data, since anyone who obtains the compressed
version of the data can use standard algorithms to decompress it.  Thus,
compression is used for efficiency, not for privacy.  When both efficiency and
privacy are desired, data is first compressed, then encrypted.
</P>
<P>
In this project, you will only perform compression, without encryption.  You
will use a standard compression library to improve
efficiency of your socket communications.
</P>
<ul>
	<li> Depending on what system you do your development on you may need to install the
	    <tt>zlib</tt> package to get the compression library and its documentation.  </li>
	<li> When working with a new library, it is often easiest to start with
		a very simple application.  A multi-process application like our
		client, server, and shell is intrinsically complex.
		You may find it much easier to get the
		compression/decompression code working in a simple program that reads
		from and writes to a pipe.
		Then, after you have it working, you can integrate that code into your
		client and server.
		</li>
	<li> Add a <strong><tt>--compress</tt></strong>
		command line option to
		your client and server which, if included, will enable compression
		(of all traffic in both directions). </li>
	<li> Modify both the client and server applications to compress
		traffic before sending it over the network and decompress it after
		receiving it.
		<br>
		<strong>Note</strong> that you are not sending a continuous data stream in either
		direction.  Rather you are sending a series of independent
		messages (each of which must be complete and an integer number
		of bytes long).
		Make sure that you <u>choose the appropriate <tt>Z_SYNC_</tt> option</u>
		when you are doing your compression
		(and decompression).
		</li>
	<li> Using these options, run a session and use the
	 	<strong><tt>--log</tt></strong> option to verify that compression
		and decompression are working properly. The <strong><tt>--log</tt></strong>
		option should record outgoing data post-compression and incoming data
		pre-decompression.
		You should expect to see:
		<ol type="1">
		   <li>no clear text going either to or from the shell</li>
		   <li>a reduction in the number of bytes sent in both directions</li>
		</ol>
		</li>
	<li> Do not include your <strong><tt>--log</tt></strong> files with your
		submission; we will generate our own from your program.  </li>
</ul>
